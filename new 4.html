	  <h1>The 2012 USA Mens Olympic Basketball Team</h1>
	  <h2>The US went undefeated but appeared vulnerable in five exhibition games. They finished the tournament with a perfect 8â€“0 record, defeating opponents by an average of 32 points while trailing in the fourth quarter only once. The Americans often played with a small lineup that emphasized speed, quickness, and outside shooting. The team set an Olympic single-game record with 156 points scored against Nigeria in the preliminary round. In a rematch of the 2008 finals, Team USA again defeated Spain to capture the gold. </h2>
